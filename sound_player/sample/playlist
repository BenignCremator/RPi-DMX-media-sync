# Sample Soundwidget playlist
# Here's a format: index #, filename, everything following is ignored
# One entry per line
# Hash indicates comment: everything following a hash is ignored
# If an index number is repeated, last one wins
# So something like follows:

1 animals001.wav This is a comment
2 animals002.wav 
3 animals003.wav
  # this is also a comment
4 animals004.wav
5 animals005.wav
6 animals006.wav
7 animals007.wav
8 animals008.wav
5 animals009.wav  Index #5 points to this file, despite the previous
     		  # definition. 

8 animals.wav
9 animals001.wav

# Note: this is a suggestion only.
